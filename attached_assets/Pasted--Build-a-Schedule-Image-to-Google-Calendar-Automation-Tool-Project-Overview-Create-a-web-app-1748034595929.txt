# Build a Schedule Image to Google Calendar Automation Tool

## Project Overview
Create a web application that allows users to upload images/screenshots of schedules, automatically extracts date/time information using OCR and AI, and adds the extracted events to their Google Calendar.

## Core Features Required

### 1. Image Upload Interface
- Clean, modern web interface for image upload
- Support for common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP)
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Preview uploaded image before processing
- Progress indicator during processing

### 2. OCR and Text Extraction
- Integrate OCR capability to extract text from uploaded images
- Use Google Vision API, Tesseract.js, or similar OCR service
- Handle various image qualities and orientations
- Preprocess images if needed (contrast, rotation correction)

### 3. Intelligent Schedule Parsing
- Use AI to parse extracted text and identify:
  - Dates (various formats: MM/DD, DD/MM, "Monday", "Jan 15", etc.)
  - Times (12-hour, 24-hour formats)
  - Event titles/descriptions
  - Duration or end times
- Handle table formats, list formats, and free-text schedules
- Extract recurring events if applicable

### 4. Google Calendar Integration
- Implement Google Calendar API integration
- OAuth2 authentication for user's Google account
- Create calendar events with:
  - Event title
  - Start date/time
  - End date/time (calculated or extracted)
  - Description/notes
  - Location (if found in image)

### 5. Preview and Confirmation
- Show extracted events in a table/list format before adding to calendar
- Allow users to edit extracted information
- Batch add multiple events
- Confirmation of successful calendar additions

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js or Vue.js with modern UI components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for clean, responsive design
- **File Handling**: File upload with validation and preview
- **State Management**: For tracking upload progress and extracted data

### Backend
- **Language**: Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI
- **OCR Integration**: Google Vision API or Tesseract integration
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API or similar for intelligent text parsing
- **Google API**: Google Calendar API with proper authentication
- **File Storage**: Temporary storage for uploaded images

### Database (Optional)
- Store processing history and user preferences
- SQLite for simple deployment or PostgreSQL for production

## Specific Implementation Details

### OCR Processing Function
```javascript
// Create a function that:
// 1. Accepts image file
// 2. Calls OCR service
// 3. Returns extracted text
// 4. Handles errors gracefully
```

### AI Parsing Prompt Template
Create an AI prompt that instructs the model to:
- Extract schedule information from OCR text
- Return data in structured JSON format
- Handle various date/time formats
- Identify event titles and descriptions
- Make reasonable assumptions for missing information

### Google Calendar Event Creation
```javascript
// Function to:
// 1. Authenticate with Google Calendar API
// 2. Create events from parsed data
// 3. Handle API rate limits
// 4. Return success/failure status
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Landing Page**: Clear explanation of tool purpose with upload button
2. **Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload image
3. **Processing**: Loading indicator while OCR and AI parsing occur
4. **Review**: Display extracted events in editable table format
5. **Confirm**: User can modify events before adding to calendar
6. **Success**: Confirmation with links to created calendar events

## Error Handling

- Invalid image formats
- OCR failures or poor image quality
- AI parsing errors or unrecognizable schedule formats
- Google Calendar API authentication failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Rate limiting from external APIs

## Security Considerations

- Secure file upload validation
- Proper Google OAuth2 implementation
- Temporary image storage with automatic cleanup
- API key protection
- User data privacy (don't store personal calendar information)

## Deployment Requirements

- **Frontend**: Deployable to Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or traditional server
- **Environment Variables**: For API keys and configuration
- **HTTPS**: Required for Google Calendar API integration

## Sample Response Format for AI Parsing

The AI should return extracted schedule data in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "Team Meeting",
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "startTime": "09:00",
      "endTime": "10:00",
      "description": "Weekly team sync",
      "location": "Conference Room A"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "originalText": "Full OCR extracted text"
}
```

## Additional Features (Nice to Have)

- Support for multiple calendar accounts
- Recurring event detection
- Time zone handling
- Calendar conflict detection
- Export to other calendar applications
- Mobile-responsive design
- Offline processing capability

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for parsing logic
- Integration tests for Google Calendar API
- End-to-end testing with sample schedule images
- Error handling validation
- Performance testing with large images

Please build this application with modern web development best practices, clean code architecture, and comprehensive error handling. Focus on user experience and make the tool intuitive for non-technical users.
